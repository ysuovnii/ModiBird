# Flappy Bird 

This is a beginner-friendly recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Python and Pygame. You control a pixelated bird that must flap through gaps in pipes to survive. Simple mechanics, retro visuals, and a fun arcade experience!



## ⚠️ Important Note

> ✅ This game **only runs properly when the project folder is opened in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** or any terminal where the working directory is set to the game folder.

Running the file directly from outside the folder (e.g. by double-clicking `main.py`) or from online IDEs **will cause asset-loading errors**.



## Features

- 🖱️ **Mouse-controlled bird movement** – Left-click to descend, right-click to ascend
- 📈 **Time-based score counter** – Increases as long as the bird survives
- 🧱 **Random pipe obstacle generation** – Pipes spawn with random vertical gaps
- 💀 **Collision detection** – Game ends if the bird hits a pipe
- 🐥 **Animated bird sprite** – 3-frame flap animation loop
- 🛑 **Game Over screen** – With a “Resume” button to quickly restart
- 🟩 **Start menu** – “Start” button to begin the game
- 🎨 **Retro pixel art** – Custom background, bird, pipe, and base assets



## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame (2.0+)
